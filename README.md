## Basic Overview

Ant Media Server is a streaming engine software that provides adaptive, ultra low latency streaming by using WebRTC technology with ~0.5 seconds latency or low latency by using HLS or CMAF. Ant Media Server is highly scalable both horizontally and vertically, running on-premises or on any cloud provider of your choice.
