# How to contribute

Third-party patches are essential for keeping the project going; We are a small team and need your help.
There are a few guidelines that we need contributors to follow so that we can stay on top of things.

## Getting Started

* Make sure you have a [GitHub account](https://github.com/signup/free)
* Submit a ticket for your issue, assuming one does not already exist.
  * Clearly describe the issue including steps to reproduce when it is a bug
  * Make sure you fill in the earliest version that you know has the issue
* Fork the repository on GitHub

## Making Changes

* Create a topic branch from where you want to base your work
  * This is usually the master branch
  * Only target release branches if you are certain your fix must be on that branch
  * To quickly create a topic branch based on master; `git checkout -b
    fix/master/my_contribution master`. Please avoid working directly on the
    `master` branch
* Comment your code
* Create junit tests to demonstrate your work
* Make commits of logical units
* Ensure the code is formatted in-line with our style guide
* Check for unnecessary whitespace with `git diff --check` before committing
* Make sure you have added the necessary tests for your changes
* Run _all_ the tests to assure nothing else was accidentally broken

## Submitting Changes

* Push your changes to a topic branch in your fork of the repository
* Submit a pull request to the repository in which you're working
